        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my personal corner of the web! I'm Felix Guzman, a passionate Web Developer with a knack for
            crafting digital experiences. I am on a journey to explore the vast realms of technology and create
            innovative solutions that leave a lasting impression.</p>

        <p>My academic background includes a Bachelor's degree in Software Development from Brigham Young University -
            Idaho, where I honed my skills in developing applications across diverse domains. During my studies, I
            delved into the world of web development, creating visually captivating, user-centric websites that adhere
            to industry standards and best practices. I'm always eager to leverage cutting-edge technologies to elevate
            my programming skills and efficiency.</p>

        <p>As a proud recipient of an Associate Certificate in Web & Computer Programming, I have engineered Single Page
            Applications (SPAs) using JavaScript and node.js. My approach to projects involves orchestrating seamless
            teamwork, promoting robust collaboration, and effective communication. I enjoy integrating APIs into
            websites to enhance functionality and user satisfaction. I'm also adept at utilizing tools like Trello for
            streamlined project management, both individually and collaboratively.</p>

        <p>Beyond my technical skills, I hold a PathwayConnect Certificate from BYU-Pathway Worldwide, emphasizing
            proficiency in English language, effective online collaboration, and the nurturing of leadership and
            problem-solving skills.</p>
